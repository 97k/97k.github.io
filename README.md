## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.

This site is not built with the intention of being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

I have revised this from [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com). Thanks to Brittany for publishing the source!

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give proper credit by linking back to [brittanychiang.com]. Thanks!

## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. Install and use the correct version of Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and update the dependencies in package.json

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install 
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   gatsby develop
   ```

## ðŸš€ Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   gatsby build
   ```

1. I have deployed the website via github pages

   ```sh
   npm install gh-pages
   ```

   [Follow the github-pages deployment docs by gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/)

## ðŸ’¡ Tips and Tricks

  ### Updating the logo
  The logo is made via svg, so you need to update [logo.js](https://github.com/97k/97k.github.io/blob/source/
  src/components/icons/logo.js)

  ### Tweaks
  Brittany has done a magnificient job in writing clean code, I am a python guy and new to gatsby js, it took me a while to understand the internsals and hence I am writing my two cents which will save your time in figuring out what to change and where.

  - Follow this [tutorial series by NetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hw1g77I35ZivVLe8k2nvjB) if you literally don't have any idea and want to replicate, this will teach you the project structure and how gatsby as SSR is solving a big problem in the industry.
  - run `gatsby clean` and re-reun `gatsby develop` as sometimes the change you have done is correct but have not reflected on the website
  - Deploy with github pages, latest gh-pages doesn't have problem with SSR local images
  - Make custom thumbains with Adobe Express / Canva
  - Be unique and use your mind and AI to write clean content
